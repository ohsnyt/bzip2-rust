//! Rust version of the standard BZIP2 library.
//!
//! Version 0.5.0
//! 
//! This Rust version of BZIP2 is based on the standard BZIP2 C implementation. This does NOT implement the library calls. Why? The C library
//! calls require that the caller allocate memory and pass that to the library. If I implemented this as a library, I would have no ability
//! to "guarentee" that the calling code has safely allocated and passed pointers to memory. (Rust is based on assumptions about safe memory 
//! management, and to the best of my current understanding violates the basic tennents that underpin safe code in Rust.)
//!
//! Given that caveat, this program does
//! - Provide fast, safe compression and decompression of files using the bzip2 format.
//! - Utilize multi-core multi-threaded processing. 
//! - Contain SA-IS sorting to improve compression speeds on repetative data.
//!
//! Basic usage to compress a files is as follows:
//! 
//! `bzip2 -z test.txt`
//! 
//! This will compress the file and create the file test.txt.bz2.
//! 
//! 
//! Basic usage to decompress a files is as follows:
//! 
//! Â `bzip2 -d test.txt.bz2`
//! 
//! 
//! Help is available by entering:
//! 
//! `bzip2 --help`
//! 
//! NOTES: 
//! - The C version is very well written. Julian Seward implemented many insightful optimizations. But documentation... well this is much more
//! documented than the C version.
//! - Developer feedback is welcome. If you have suggestions for improvement, please let me know!
//! - This version compresses about 25% slower than the C version for tiny files. This is faster on larger files.
//! - It is particularly faster when using the SA-IS sorting algorithm as the fallback sorting algorithm.
//! - This version is about 25% slower than the C version for decompression. That said, BZIP2 decompression is pretty fast.
