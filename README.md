# bzip2-rust
Rust implementation of Bzip2 library. This is later alpha stage. Use at your own risk. *Some features are not yet implemented.*

The goal of the executable is to allow for near 100% compatibility with the existing C version of the Bzip2 executable.

The C version of Bzip2 contains a library and several stand-alone tools to work with files (including damaged, compressed files). I do *not* attempt to reproduce those tools.
